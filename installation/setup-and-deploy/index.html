It supports any mixture of the <em>Linux</em> based Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty" or Debian 8 "Jessie" operating systems for the Cider-CI Server and executors. Since Cider-CI version 3.7 "Redmond" executors running on <em>Windows</em> are supported, too. It is also possible to install a Cider-CI executor manually on other operating systems currently not supported for automatic setup, e.g. "Mac OS X".</p> <p>A working Cider-CI environment includes <strong>exactly one <em>Cider-CI Server</em></strong> and virtually <strong>any number of <em>Cider-CI Executors</em></strong>. In most most environments every component runs in its own machine. It is possible to run the server and one executor within the same machine. We <strong>recommend against running an executor in the same machine as the server</strong> in <strong>larger environments</strong> and in particular when the working efficiency of <strong>several users</strong> depends on the system, which is often the case.</p> <p>However a single machine environment can make sense for light use cases, e.g. when a sigle developer wants occasionally to run tests. A single machine setup is also easier to set-up and less demanding when it comes to interaction of the machines with respect to network configuration and firewalls in particular. It gets very simple if this machine also acts as the <em>control machine</em>. The control machine is purely used for deployment. It doesn't play a role when the Cider-CI environment is performing its daily business.</p> <h2 id=example-environments>Example Environments</h2> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-6> <p>We will use two exemplary environments for illustration. There is the <strong><em>simple</em> demo environment</strong>. One single Linux machine hosts the server, executor and also the control machine.</p> <p>The <strong><em>advanced</em> demo environment</strong> consists of a server, an executor running on Linux, an executor running on Windows, and a control machine.</p> <p>We choose one of the two examples as a template when we will actually configure and deploy our environment. We recommend to use the simple example when installing Cider-CI for the first time.</p> <p>You can still go with the advanced example even if you don't plan to use windows. We will remove the windows host from the configuration in this case later on.</p> <pre><code>  "Simple" Demo Environment: 1 Machine, only local connections

</code></pre> </div> </div> <h2 id=prerequisites-and-preparation>Prerequisites and Preparation</h2> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy">Cider-CI Deploy Project</a> relies heavily on Ansible which must be present on the <em>control</em> machine. The control machine orchestrates deployment and updates.</p> <p>See the <a href="//docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html">Install</a> page of the Ansible Documentation to install Ansible. Alternatively you might want to have look at the <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy/blob/master/bin/quick-install.sh#L37-L38">two Ansible related lines of the quick-install script</a> to quickly install Ansbile without hassle. We use a fairly recent version (≥ 1.9 at the time of writing) of Ansible. The operating system on the controller is not relevant. We use <em>Mac OS X</em> and various <em>Linux</em> variants.</p> <p>It is possible to run use a machine which is part of the Cider-CI environment as a control machine (as long it is not a Windows machine). The simplest Cider-CI environment combines the server, executor and control machine in one single instance. This is actually what happens when you follow the [Quick Start] guide which is essentially performed by the already mentioned <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy/blob/master/bin/quick-install.sh">quick-install script</a>.</p> <p>The working account on the <strong>control machine</strong> must have <strong>ssh access to all Linux target machines</strong>. A setup with SSH keys and without passwords to the root account is the most straight forward configuration.</p> <p>It must have also access via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426(v=vs.85).aspx">WinRM</a> to <strong>all Windows executors</strong>. There is also some extra setup to be performed on the control machine in this case. Please read and follow the instructions on the <a href="//docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_windows.html">Windows Support</a> page of the Ansible documentation.</p> <p>Every executor needs during installation and for operation access via HTTPS to the server. The server dispatches via HTTPS during normal operation. There is also a pull only mode. More to this later.</p> <p><strong>Make sure that all of the depicted connections are possible and actually do work in your environment.</strong></p> <h2 id=project-checkout-and-inventory-setup>Project Checkout and Inventory Setup</h2> <h3 id=cloning>Cloning</h3> <p>We login to our control machine and clone the complete Cider-CI project including all submodules. The <code>master</code> branch contains the most recent stable version and is usually a good choice.</p> <p><code>git clone -b master https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci.git --recursive</code></p> <p>We descend into the deploy directory/project.</p> <p><code>cd cider-ci/deploy</code></p> <h3 id=inventory>Inventory</h3> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-6> <p>There is an inventory directory which contains two demo environments. See the tree structure in the provided code snippet.</p> <p>The main inventory files are <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy/blob/master/inventories/demo/simple/hosts"><code>inventories/demo/simple/hosts</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy/blob/master/inventories/demo/advanced/hosts"><code>inventories/demo/advanced/hosts</code></a> respectively. They define the machines (or hosts) as the name of the file suggests. The other files are group or machine related configuration files. We <strong>copy either of the two inventories</strong> to a place outside the repository.</p> <p><code>cp -rv inventories/demo/simple PATH-TO-OUR-INVENTORY</code></p> <p>or</p> <p><code>cp -rv inventories/demo/advanced PATH-TO-OUR-INVENTORY</code></p> <p>We will modify our freshly created inventory in the next sections.

These variables are defined in the file <a href="https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_deploy/blob/master/group_vars/all.yml">group_vars/all.yml</a> (relative to the top level deploy project). We recommend to have a look into the file to see what variables are available. The secrets section towards the end is in particular relevant with respect to redefining the <code>cider_ci_master_secret</code>.</p> <p>The following explains slightly simplified rules for variable precedence. The precise rules are explained in […] but there should be no need to dive that deep into the matter unless we run into problems.</p> <p>This <code>all.yml</code> file is the first one consulted for variable definitions. Then comme the <code>group_vars</code> in the individual inventory (relative to the <code>hosts</code> file), then the <code>host_vars</code>. Finally command line options for <code>ansible</code> or <code>ansible-playbook</code> will override any variable which were set before. We will make use of this when performing a deploy in the next section.</p> <h2 id=deploy>Deploy</h2> <p>We will now deploy our configured Cider-CI environment:</p> <p><code>ANSIBLE_LOAD_CALLBACK_PLUGINS=1 DEPLOY_ROOT_DIR=`pwd` ansible-playbook -i PATH-TO-OUR-INVENTORY -e "admin_password=SOME-SECRET"</code></p> <p>The deploy can take a while. We can expect at least 30 minutes for an initial deploy. It can take much longer depending on the power of the machines and moreover the on the speed of the internet connection.</p> <p>The deploy depends on a lot of downloads from the internet. If one download fails the deploy will abort. It is possible to invoke the command at any time later again.</p> <h2 id=where-to-go-from-here>Where to go from here</h2> <p>Add your own project to your installation and configure it which is covered in <a href="/project-configuration/">Project Configuration</a>. You will probably need a few more traits on top of the default ones. Read about adding traits to your executor in <a href="/installation/adding-traits">Adding Traits</a>. If you want learn about how to set up an production like Cider-CI environment read <a href="">Advanced Installation</a>.</p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
