      This is a job with probabilistic outcome. The tasks in this job succeed
      with probability 1/7.

      One task will use two non parallel retries and is likely to fail.

      One task will use up to 12 retries (non parallel) and is likely to succeed.

      The last task will use up to 5 parallel retries.
